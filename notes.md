# eslint
## Temporary disabled
These rules were disabled to avoid conflict with Typescript because they're not currently handled correctly by the typescript-eslint-parser
- no-useless-constructor
- no-unused-vars
- class-methods-use-this

These rules were disabled to enable Angular 1 support:
- global-require

These rules were disabled because of the Webpack config:
- import/no-unresolved
- import/extensions

These rules are good but were disabled for legacy code:
- no-undef
- camelcase
- consistent-return
- no-use-before-define

These rules are controversial:
- no-extra-boolean-cast
